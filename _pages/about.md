I am a Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.  I received my MMath (with Certificate in University Teaching) from the University of Waterloo and my BSc from the University of Prince Edward Island.
<br><br>
I regularly teach introductory programming courses and have co-developed two Coursera MOOCs ([LTP1](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1){:target="_blank"} and [LTP2](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2){:target="_blank"}) on learning to program in Python.  I am also engaged in Computer Science education [projects](/publications) and co-authored an [introductory textbook](https://pragprog.com/titles/gwpy3/practical-programming-third-edition/){:target="_blank"} on Python programming.
<br><br>
I was awarded the President's Teaching Award, UofT's highest teaching honour, in 2021 and the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science Outstanding Teaching Award in 2014.
